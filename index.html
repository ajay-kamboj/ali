            Muhammad Ali (/ɑːˈliː/;[4] born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.;[5] January 17, 1942 – June 3, 2016) was an
            American professional boxer and activist.
            Nicknamed "the Greatest", he is regarded as one of the most significant sports figures of the 20th century
            and is often regarded as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time.
            He held the Ring magazine heavyweight title from 1964 to 1970.
            He was the undisputed champion from 1974 to 1978 and the WBA and Ring heavyweight champion from 1978 to
            1979.
            In 1999, he was named Sportsman of the Century by Sports Illustrated and the Sports Personality of the
            Century by the BBC.
            Clay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker.
            From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19–0 with 15 wins by knockout. He defeated boxers
            including Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, LaMar
            Clark, Doug Jones, and Henry Cooper. Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a
            1962 match.[47][48]

            These early fights were not without trials. Clay was knocked down by both Sonny Banks and Cooper. In the
            Cooper fight, Clay was floored by a left hook at the end of round four and was saved by the bell, going on
            to win in the predicted fifth round due to Cooper's severely cut eye. The fight with Doug Jones on March 13,
            1963, was Clay's toughest fight during this stretch. The number two and three heavyweight contenders
            respectively, Clay and Jones fought on Jones' home turf at New York's Madison Square Garden. Jones staggered
            Clay in the first round, and the unanimous decision for Clay was greeted by boos and a rain of debris thrown
            into the ring. Watching on closed-circuit TV, heavyweight champ Sonny Liston quipped that if he fought Clay
            he (Liston) might get locked up for murder. The fight was later named "Fight of the Year" by The Ring
            magazine.[49]

            In each of these fights, Clay vocally belittled his opponents and vaunted his abilities. He called Jones "an
            ugly little man" and Cooper a "bum". He said he was embarrassed to get in the ring with Alex Miteff and
            claimed that Madison Square Garden was "too small for me."[50] Ali's trash talk was inspired by professional
            wrestler "Gorgeous George" Wagner's, after he saw George's talking ability attract huge crowds to
            events.[51] Ali stated in a 1969 interview with the Associated Press' Hubert Mizel that he met with George
            in Las Vegas in 1961, that George told him that talking a big game would earn paying fans who either wanted
            to see him win or wanted to see him lose, thus Ali transformed himself into a self-described "big-mouth and
            a bragger".[52]

            In 1960, Clay left Moore's camp, partially due to Clay's refusal to do chores such as washing dishes and
            sweeping. To replace Moore, Clay hired Angelo Dundee to be his trainer. Clay had met Dundee in February 1957
            during Clay's amateur career.[53] Around this time, Clay sought longtime idol Sugar Ray Robinson to be his
            manager, but was rebuffed.[54]
